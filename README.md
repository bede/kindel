# Kindel: indel-aware consensus calling

[![JOSS status](http://joss.theoj.org/papers/117efd1fc35bb2011311f73d3fa0b545/status.svg)](http://joss.theoj.org/papers/117efd1fc35bb2011311f73d3fa0b545)  
[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/kindel.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/kindel)  
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bede/kindel.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bede/kindel)  

A consensus caller that generates majority consensus sequence(s) from just a BAM file, reconciling small  CIGAR-described indels to maximise read-to-reference concordance. Kindel also permits recovery of consensus sequence across highly divergent regions (such as  those encoding viral envelope proteins) where regions of reads cannot be aligned. With **`--realign`**, Kindel identifies regions of the reference that are clip-dominant (>depth\*0.5) and attempts to assemble a patched consensus using the unaligned sequence context. Existing consensus calling approaches are complicated and often involve a variant calling step. Developed for use with small virus genomes. An [elegant streaming approach](https://github.com/karel-brinda/ococo) was recently released but cannot reconcile indels. Update: [Pilon](https://github.com/broadinstitute/pilon) also now solves similar problems.



### Core functionality

### Reassembly of clip-dominant regions (CDRs) with `--realign`

## Features
- [x] Consensus of aligned substititutions, insertions and deletions

- [x] Gap closure (`--realign`) using overlapping soft-clipped alignment context

- [x] Tested with Illumina alignments from BWA, Minimap2 and Segemehl 

- [x] Support for BAMs with multiple reference contigs, chromosomes

- [x] Naive frequency-based variant calling with `kindel variants` (no VCF output)

  

### Todo
- [ ] Customisable threshold weight
- [ ] Numpy rewrite to handle bacterial long read sequences
- [ ] Optionally gap fill using a supplied reference
- [ ] Parallelism



## Limitations

- [ ] Slow (10-20k records/s), & will probably explode with bacterial genomes
- [ ] SAM/BAM files must contain an SQ header line with reference sequence(s) length
- [ ] Able to close gaps of up to 2x read length given adequate depth of coverage
- [ ] May require multiple runs to converge on a consensus



## Installation

```python
# Requires Python 3.5+
pip3 install kindel
```
Dependencies should automatically installed, except for Samtools which is needed for BAM input.



## Usage
