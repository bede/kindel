# Kindel – indel-aware offline consensus calling for nucleotide alignments
[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/kindel.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/kindel)

Kindel is a simple consensus caller which takes a headed SAM/BAM file as input and generates a *single chromosome* consensus in fasta format. Unlike similar tools it correctly reconciles small indels described in CIGAR fields. **An experimental feature `--fix-gaps` can reconcile longer gaps and consensus insertions by leveraging context from unaligned (soft-clipped) regions of sequences.**

Existing consensus calling approaches are complicated and often involve a variant calling step. While an [elegant streaming approach](https://github.com/karel-brinda/ococo) was recently released, it cannot reconcile indels.


## Installation
```
pip3 install kindel
```
Dependencies should automatically installed, except for Samtools which is needed for BAM input.


## Usage
### Command line
```
$ kindel consensus --fix-gaps --min-depth 10 alignment.bam
```
The consensus fasta is sent to `stdout` and a report to `stderr`
```

## Issues
Please let me know if you run into problems by opening a GitHub issue, [tweeting](https://twitter.com/beconstant) or mailing me via `b at bede dawt im`.
- Master may be broken – use PYPI or a tagged release
- Conceived for use with viral genomes – requires a single chromosome reference sequence
- Tested only with alignments generated by BWA
- SAM/BAM files must contain an SQ header line containing the reference sequence length.
- `--fix-gaps` may require multiple runs to converge on the optimal consensus
- Slow (10-20k records/s)

## Features
- [x] Reconciliation of CIGAR described insertions and deletions
- [x] Gap closure (`--fix-gaps`) using soft-clipped alignment context (not yet in tagged release)
- [ ] Support mutiple reference sequences (needs testing)
- [ ] Support / test against SAMs from a variety of aligners
- [ ] Substitution only mode (`--ignore-indels`)
- [ ] Frequency based variant calling with `kindel variants`
- [ ] Plotting
