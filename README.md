# Kindel – indel-aware consensus calling

[![JOSS status](http://joss.theoj.org/papers/117efd1fc35bb2011311f73d3fa0b545/status.svg)](http://joss.theoj.org/papers/117efd1fc35bb2011311f73d3fa0b545)  

A consensus caller which accepts a headed SAM/BAM input and generates a majority rule consensus in fasta format,  reconciling small indels described in CIGAR fields so as to maximise read-reference concordance. Kindel also permits recovery of consensus sequence across highly divergent regions (such as  those encoding viral envelope proteins) where regions of reads cannot be aligned. With **`--realign`**, Kindel identifies regions of the reference that are clip-dominant (>depth\*0.5) and attempts to assemble a patched consensus using the unaligned sequence context.

Existing consensus calling approaches are complicated and often involve a variant calling step. An [elegant streaming approach](https://github.com/karel-brinda/ococo) was recently released but cannot reconcile indels.




## Installation
```python
# Requires Python 3.5+
pip install kindel
```
Dependencies should automatically installed, except for Samtools which is needed for BAM input.


## Usage
### Command line
```
$ kindel consensus --realign alignment.bam
```
The consensus fasta is sent to `stdout` and a report to `stderr`
```

### Python API
```python
from kindel import kindel

kindel.bam_to_consensus(bam_path, realign=False, min_depth=2, min_overlap=7,
                        clip_decay_threshold=0.1, trim_ends=False, uppercase=False)
```

## Issues
Please let me know if you run into problems by opening a GitHub issue, [tweeting](https://twitter.com/beconstant) or mailing me via `b at bede dawt im`.
- Conceived for use with highly diverse Hepatitis C populations – untested with anything larger
- SAM/BAM files must contain an SQ header line containing the reference sequence length
- Able to close gaps of up to 2x read length given adequate depth of coverage
- Sometimes requires multiple runs to converge on an optimal consensus
- Slow (10-20k records/s)

## Features
- [x] Reconciliation of CIGAR described insertions and deletions
- [x] Gap closure (`--realign`) using soft-clipped alignment context
- [ ] Support mutiple reference sequences (needs testing)
- [x] Support SAMs from multiple aligners – tested BWA MEM, Segemehl
- [x] Frequency based variant calling with `kindel variants` (no VCF output)
- [x] Plotting of clip frequencies
